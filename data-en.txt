I will go in the hut. Go in the car and visit me. I see a kite up in the sky. The plane will go up. A jet can go up in the sky. The dog is in the yard with me. My mom and dad love me. The dog and I go up the hill. 
We can go for it. It is not my hat. The can is for my dog. It is not far to go. It is for my mom. We can go to my room. It is not my can. My bat is fun for me.
Help me make a big hut. I can look at you play. I can see you run. Help me look for my big dog. You are big and I see you. Look at the big can. We can play and help look. You make my dog run and play.
My dad said to come here. I can jump two times. I look funny when I jump. I can say one, two, three. Jump one time and come here. I said three funny jokes. I said here is a funny hat. Here is one big, funny dog.
Run down and find a red bat. Look where the yellow cat is. My leg is a little red where I fell. It is a funny, little book. The blue car can go away. My bike is down where I left it. The sky is a little blue. I can find the red, blue and yellow hat.
I will be on all the mats. I am on the list. Yes, it is fun but I am hot. No kid will be at the top. But he can be on my side. Yes, he will be at the pool. I say yes, but he says no. No hat can be on a dog.
He did say hi. He will like it so much. I get so sad. He will get to say it. I like a good dog. He did a good job. He will get so big. He did say he will like it. 
She saw I ran into the hut. I ate well and she ate well. I like to ride into the shop. She ran well and she ran far. She will ride into the wall. Do you like to ride a sled? I do like to ride a bike. She ran into the park and saw me.
The dog was brown too. The maps are black and white. The cats have white feet too. The black cats are here now too. It was black but now it is brown. I have too many white hats. The white fish are black now. Her hats are now white too.
They came to the new shop to eat. All four boys went out that door. I came to eat that. They are good and they came back. He must eat out a lot. The new boy came to eat four times. She went out that way. I must eat that at four.
He will want to go with me soon. There is the pretty dog with the boy. This is the pretty cat under my leg. What is this under my hat? This is what I want. Soon he will want to eat the pretty cake. What is under this tent with me? I want to go there with you soon.
Please ask who they are. Soon I will say please. They are under our car. Who is there with you? They eat at the shop. I have our book for him. Please get our hat. They like our cat.
The red tomato is delicious.
